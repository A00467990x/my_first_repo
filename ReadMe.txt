Summary of the topic that brought us together:
     We chose travelling. We spoke and found out that we love travelling, seeing different cultures, and exploring new places. In fact, the
day before classes began, Samuel had just arrived from Rwanda where he went to visit and attend a cultural wedding there. It is good to 
break out of your normal schedule and some exciting, new activities and travelling to a new location allows this. Whether it is jet skiing 
in Ibiza, or riding a 4-wheel drive in Dubai, there are different activities to try for every and anyone, not to mention the amazing 
Instagram pictures you get out of it to post to make your friends jealous lol
